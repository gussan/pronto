Pronto runs analysis quickly by checking only the relevant changes. Created to
be used on pull requests, but suited for other scenarios as well. Perfect if you
want to find out quickly if branch introduces changes that conform to your
[styleguide](https://github.com/mmozuras/pronto-rubocop), [are DRY](https://github.com/mmozuras/pronto-flay), [don't introduce security holes](https://github.com/mmozuras/pronto-brakeman) and [more](#runners).

## Usage

### Pull Requests

You can run Pronto as part of your builds and then get results as comments
using `GithubFormatter`.

Add Pronto runners you want to use to your Gemfile:
```ruby
  gem 'pronto-rubocop'
```
or gemspec file:
```ruby
  s.add_development_dependency 'pronto-rubocop'
```
Set environment variable GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN to OAuth token that has access to
repository. Then set it up to run using the included rake task or manually:
```ruby
  Pronto.gem_names.each { |gem_name| require "pronto/#{gem_name}" }

  formatter = Pronto::Formatter::GithubFormatter.new
  Pronto.run('origin/master', '.', formatter)
```

### Local Changes

```bash
  gem install pronto
  gem install pronto-rubocop
```
Then navigate to repository you want run Pronto on, and:
